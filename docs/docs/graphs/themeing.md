# Themeing
Themeing for UI Attributes Graphs XYChart is done through [UI Builder](https://bitbucket.org/leverege/ui-builder){:target="_blank"}.

Here is a list of customizable values and their corresponding color variables in UI Builder:

| To Customize... | Set this color variable in UI Builder... |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Series Line/Bar Color | graphSeries1 - graphSeries7 |

| X-Axis Label | graphXAxisLabel |
| Y-Axis Label | graphYAxisLabel |
| X-Tick Label | graphXTickLabel |
| Y-Tick Label | graphYTickLabel |

These values can also be overridden using custom renderer plugins, such as a [Custom Graph Background Renderer](../plugin-points/graph-background) or [Custom Series Renderer](../plugin-points/series-renderers)
